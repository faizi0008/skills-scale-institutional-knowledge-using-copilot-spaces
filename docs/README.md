# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management processes. This README provides a concise summary of how we plan, execute, and improve projects at OctoAcme and direct links to our standardized process documents for easy navigation by new and existing team members.

OctoAcme runs projects with a customer-first, iterative approach: work is organized into small, testable increments that deliver value quickly and generate fast feedback. Planning focuses on measurable outcomes and prioritized user impact, and execution is broken into short cycles (sprints or iterations) with defined acceptance criteria. Each cycle produces demonstrable progress and data that feed planning and retrospectives for continuous learning.

Roles and ownership are explicit: product owners define outcomes and priorities, project managers (or technical leads) coordinate delivery and cross-functional alignment, engineering teams implement features and maintain technical quality, and QA owns verification and release gating. Standardized artifacts (project charters, plans, backlogs, and release checklists) ensure responsibilities and expectations are documented and discoverable.

Communication is structured and asynchronous-first: written artifacts in the docs and issue tracker are the primary source of truth, supported by regular syncs (planning, standups, demos, and retrospectives) for alignment. Stakeholder updates use concise status reports and escalation paths defined in the risk & communication guide to keep decision-makers informed without blocking teams.

Quality assurance emphasizes automated testing, a clear definition of done, and release gating. QA and engineering collaborate on test automation, CI pipelines, and pre-release validation; code reviews, pair programming, and feature toggles reduce risk in production. Post-release monitoring and retrospectives close the feedback loop and drive continuous improvement.
